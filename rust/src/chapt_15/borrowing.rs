/*
Most of the time, we want to access data without taking ownership over it.
Can do so using the borrowing mechanism. Instead of passing objects by value T,
objects can be passed by reference &T.

References always point to valid objects, meaning while a reference to T exist,
T cannot be destroyed. Guaranteed via the brrow checker.
